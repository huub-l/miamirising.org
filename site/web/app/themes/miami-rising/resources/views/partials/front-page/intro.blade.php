          <p>Climate change and sea level rise continue to threaten the future of Miami-Dade’s coastline and water supply (Greenprint, 2010). The most recent U.S. National Climate Assessment declared Miami as a city most at risk to effects of sea level rise and climate change (2014). Florida Atlantic University’s methodology for projecting sea level rise predicts that South Florida will see a rise in sea level of about 3-7 inches by 2030 (FAU, 2012), which represents a significant increase from past projections.</p> 
          <p>Now more than ever as we work to build people-centered solutions for living with sea level rise, it is critical that our community demand climate action from our elected leaders.</p>
