Provides Action Network (actionnetwork.org) action embed codes as shortcodes and a calendar and signup widget

== Description ==

A free Wordpress plugin for the [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org) online organizing tools, developed by [Jonathan Kissam](http://jonathankissam.com/).

Features:

* Create a Wordpress shortcode or widget from any Action Network embed code.
* Manage your saved embed codes using the Wordpress backend. Supports sorting by title, type and last modified date, and provides a search function.
* Modify Action Network's default "thank you for your support" and "help us by using sharing tools" messages, and control which sharing options (social, email & embed codes) are displayed, using shortcode options or widget controls.
* Use `[actionnetwork_list]` shortcode or Action Network List widget to show a list of current actions.
* Use `[actionnetwork_calendar]` shortcode or Action Network Calendar widget to show a list of upcoming events. Optionally outputs upcoming events in JSON. Development of this feature was supported by [The People's Lobby](http://www.thepeopleslobbyusa.org/) - if you like it, please consider [making a donation to them](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/donate-to-the-peoples-lobby).
* If you are an [Action Network Partner](https://actionnetwork.org/partnerships), use your API key to sync all of your actions from Action Network to Wordpress.
* Create signup widgets which allow visitors to your site to sign up for your email list _without_ using Action Network javascript embeds. This allows you to place a signup form on every page (for example in the sidebar), and still load Action Network embed codes for actions on particular pages (since Action Network's scripts will only load one embed code per page).  This feature does require the API key, so you have to be an [Action Network Partner](https://actionnetwork.org/partnerships) to use it.

Detailed specs for shortcode attributes, widget options, etc. are available on the Help menu for the Action Network page on the backend, or in [this blog post](https://jonathankissam.wordpress.com/2017/12/27/new-version-of-my-action-network-plugin/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. If you have an [Action Network API Key](https://actionnetwork.org/partnerships), go to the Action Network section and click on the "Settings" tab to enter your API key. Your actions will automatically be synced from Action Network to your Wordpress site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
